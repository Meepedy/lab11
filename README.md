### I like how thorough the lab was in explaining each task. I think David and Jess did a really good job working as a team to discuss both how the JS and the CSS could look to complete this LAB. It encourages me to do things my own way.. rather than just struggle to figure out how to do it.. which will be necessary at later stages when it feels like a challenge and not an impossibility. For now, where I am as a student, this is perfect. I feel a healthy amount of challenge but not so much that I want to eat my troubles away and drink till I fall asleep around 6pm.
